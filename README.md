## Technologies

Built with the awesome [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).

You should probably not plug some Vue in a Jekyll website if you are planning on making a pretty complex static website but for this project it works well and it's faster than using something like [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org/).
